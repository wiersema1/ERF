.. _sec:Buoyancy:

ERF has several options for how to define the buoyancy force.

Buoyancy
=========

When using the anelastic formulation, the expression for buoyancy used by ERF is

.. math::
     \mathbf{B} = -\rho^\prime \mathbf{g} \approx -\rho_0 \mathbf{g} ( \frac{\theta_v^\prime}{\overline{\theta_0}}

where we define

.. math::
     \theta_v = \theta_d (1 - (1 - \frac{R_v}{R_d}) (q_v + q_c) - \frac{R_v}{R_d} q_c)


When using the compressible formulation, the following choices are available.


Density of the mixture
-----------------------

The total density in a cell containing air, water vapor, liquid water and precipitates is given by

.. math::
    \rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{m_a + m_v + m_c + m_p}{V},

where :math:`m_a` is the mass of dry air, :math:`m_v` is the mass of water vapor, :math:`m_c` is the mass of liquid water, and :math:`m_p` is the mass of precipitate.
From the definitions of the mass mixing ratio (ratio of mass of a component to mass of dry air), we have for any component

.. math::
    q_i \equiv \frac{m_i}{m_a}.

Using this we can write

.. math::
    \rho = m_a\frac{(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)}{V}
          = \rho_d(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p),

where :math:`\rho_d \equiv \cfrac{m_a}{V}` is the density of dry air.


Type 1
------

One version of the buoyancy force is expressed simply as

.. math::
     \mathbf{B} = \rho^\prime \mathbf{g}

.. math::
     \rho^\prime = \rho_{total} - \rho_0

where the total density :math:`\rho_{total} = \rho_d(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)` is the sum of dry and moist components and :math:`\rho_0` is the total density
for the background state. For eg., a usual scenario is that of a background state that contains only air and vapor and no cloud water or precipitates. For such a state,
the total background density :math:`\rho_0 = \rho_{d_0}(1 + q_{v_0})`, where :math:`\rho_{d_0}` and :math:`q_{v_0}` are the background dry density and vapor mixing ratio respectively.
As a check, we observe that :math:`\rho^\prime_0 = 0`, which means that the background state is not buoyant.

Type 3
------

This formulation of the buoyancy term assumes that the horizontal averages of the moisture quantities are negligible.

.. math::
     \mathbf{B} = \rho^\prime \mathbf{g} \approx -\rho_0 \mathbf{g} ( \frac{T^\prime}{\overline{T}}
                 + 0.61 q_v - q_c - q_i - q_p)

We note that this version of the buoyancy force matches that given in Marat F. Khairoutdinov and David A. Randall's paper (J. Atm Sciences, 607, 1983)
if we neglect :math:`\frac{p^\prime}{\bar{p_0}}`.

Type 4
------
This expression for buoyancy is from `khairoutdinov2003cloud`_ and `bryan2002benchmark`_.

.. _`khairoutdinov2003cloud`: https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/60/4/1520-0469_2003_060_0607_crmota_2.0.co_2.xml
.. _`bryan2002benchmark`: https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/130/12/1520-0493_2002_130_2917_absfmn_2.0.co_2.xml

.. math::

    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{B} = \rho'\mathbf{g} \approx -\rho \mathbf{g} \Bigg(\frac{T'}{T} + 0.61 q_v' - q_c - q_p - \frac{p'}{p}\Bigg)
    \end{equation}

The derivation follows. The total density is given by :math:`\rho = \rho_d(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)`, which can be written as

.. math::

    \rho = \frac{p (1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)}{R_dT\Bigg(1 + \cfrac{R_v}{R_d}q_v\Bigg)}

This can be written using binomial expansion as

.. math::

    \begin{align*}
    \rho &= \frac{p}{R_dT} (1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)\Bigg(1 + \frac{R_v}{R_d}q_v\Bigg)^{-1} \\
    &= \frac{p}{R_dT} (1 + q_v + q_c + q_p)\Bigg(1 - \frac{R_v}{R_d}q_v + O(q_v^2)\Bigg) \\
    &= \frac{p}{R_dT}\Bigg(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p - \frac{R_v}{R_d}q_v +  \text{H.O.T. such as } O(q_v^2) + O(q_vq_c)\Bigg) \\
    &\approx \frac{p}{R_dT}\Bigg(1 + q_v + q_c + q_p - \frac{R_v}{R_d}q_v\Bigg)
    \end{align*}

Taking log on both sides, we get

.. math::

    \log{\rho} = \log{p} - \log{R_d} - \log{T} + \log(1 - 0.61 q_v + q_c + q_p)

Taking derivative gives

.. math::

    \frac{\rho'}{\rho} = \frac{p'}{p} - \frac{T'}{T} + \frac{(-0.61 q_v' + q_c' + q_p')}{(1 - 0.61 q_v + q_c + q_p)}

Using :math:`- 0.61 q_v + q_c + q_p \ll 1`, we have

.. math::

    \frac{\rho'}{\rho} = \frac{p'}{p} - \frac{T'}{T} + (-0.61 q_v' + q_c' + q_p')

Since the background values of cloud water and precipitate mass mixing ratios -- :math:`q_c` and :math:`q_p` are zero, we have :math:`q_c' = q_c` and :math:`q_p' = q_p`. Hence, we have

.. math::

    \begin{equation}
    \rho'\approx -\rho\Bigg(\frac{T'}{T} + 0.61 q_v' - q_c - q_p - \frac{p'}{p}\Bigg),
    \end{equation}
